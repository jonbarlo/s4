#S4 (ScamS3) Bucket â€“ Because itâ€™s S3â€¦ but not really. ðŸš€ðŸ¤¡ ðŸª£ It is the S4 bucket (ScamS3)

## Overview
S4 (ScamS3) Bucket is a 100% authentic knockoff of AWS S3, but under the hood, itâ€™s just FTP in a trenchcoat. Built with NodeJS, this open-source abomination lets you interact with an S3-like API while secretly storing files on a janky FTP server (yes, even that crusty old IIS shared hosting youâ€™ve been avoiding and that ftp server you have to pay for will work with this).

## Why?
- Need to store files for cheap (I mean, you are using FTP, so it is already cheap)

- Need S3 compatibility but stuck with FTP-only storage?

- Want to mock S3 for testing, but extra janky? (I mean, you are using FTP, so it is already janky)

- Just enjoy scams? (No judgment.) (I mean, you are using FTP, so it is already a scam)

## Features:
âœ… S3-like API â€“ "It's basically the same!" â€“ some liar
âœ… FTP support â€“ Because why not?
âœ… Runs on garbage-tier hosting â€“ IIS? Shared hosting? We got you.
âœ… Open-source & hackable â€“ Make it worse, if you dare.

## Perfect for:
- Devs who love to build systems and need a place to store files for cheap

- Legacy systems that refuse to die

- When AWS is just too mainstream or too expensive

## Warning: May cause existential dread and regret. Use at your own risk.

## Technical Description
Scam secure storage service or S4(ScamS3) just like the s3 bucket but under the hood it is using a third party FTP server to perform read/write operations on the files, open source project built with nodeJS and the MVP will run in a shitty shared IIS server
