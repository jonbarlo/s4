# Deletion Endpoints Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the deletion endpoints that have been implemented for the S4 Bucket API. Previously, only file deletion was available, but now **complete CRUD operations** are supported across all resource types.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. File Deletion ✅ (Already existed)
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /files/:id`
- **Description**: Deletes a specific file from both the database and FTP server
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token required
- **Response**: Returns success status and confirmation message

### 2. Bucket Deletion ✅ (Newly implemented)
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /buckets/:id`
- **Description**: Deletes a bucket and **all its associated files** from both the database and FTP server
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token required
- **Safety Features**:
  - Verifies bucket ownership before deletion
  - Cascading deletion of all files in the bucket
  - Attempts to clean up FTP folder structure
- **Response**: Returns success status, confirmation message, and count of deleted files

### 3. Folder Deletion ✅ (Newly implemented)
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /folders`
- **Description**: Deletes **all files within a specific folder path** from both the database and FTP server
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token required
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "folderPath": "documents",
    "bucketId": 1
  }
  ```
- **Safety Features**:
  - Verifies bucket ownership before deletion
  - Only deletes files in the specified folder path
  - Maintains bucket structure
- **Response**: Returns success status, confirmation message, and count of deleted files

## Implementation Details

### Security Features
- **User Ownership Verification**: All endpoints verify that the user owns the resource before allowing deletion
- **JWT Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Cascading Deletion**: Bucket deletion automatically removes all associated files

### Error Handling
- **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist or user doesn't have access
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing required parameters
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side errors (FTP connection issues, database errors)

### FTP Integration
- **File Cleanup**: All endpoints remove files from the FTP server
- **Folder Cleanup**: Bucket deletion attempts to remove the FTP folder structure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if individual FTP operations fail

## Usage Examples

### Delete a File
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/files/123
```

### Delete a Bucket (and all its files)
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/buckets/456
```

### Delete Folder Contents
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"folderPath": "documents", "bucketId": 456}' \
  http://localhost:3000/folders
```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `scripts/test-deletion-endpoints.js` that verifies all deletion endpoints work correctly:

```bash
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Run the test script
node scripts/test-deletion-endpoints.js
```

## Database Impact

### File Deletion
- Removes file record from `Files` table
- Deletes file from FTP server

### Bucket Deletion
- Removes all file records from `Files` table where `bucketId` matches
- Removes bucket record from `Buckets` table
- Deletes all files from FTP server
- Attempts to remove FTP folder

### Folder Deletion
- Removes file records from `Files` table where `targetFTPfolder` matches
- Deletes matching files from FTP server
- Maintains bucket structure

## Next Steps

With deletion endpoints now fully implemented, consider:

1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests on all deletion scenarios
2. **Monitoring**: Add logging for deletion operations
3. **Recovery**: Consider implementing soft delete or recycle bin functionality
4. **Batch Operations**: Implement bulk deletion for multiple resources
5. **Audit Trail**: Track deletion operations for compliance

## Notes

- **Irreversible**: All deletions are permanent and cannot be undone
- **FTP Dependencies**: Deletion requires FTP server connectivity
- **Performance**: Large buckets with many files may take time to delete
- **Error Recovery**: Failed deletions are logged but may leave orphaned records
