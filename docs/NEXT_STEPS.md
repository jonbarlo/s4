# Next Steps for S4 (ScamS3) Project

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Done
- Environment variable loading is robust and production-safe.
- DB connection and models are working.
- All main routers (auth, buckets, files, folders) are restored and tested in production.
- Health and debug endpoints confirm everything is working.
- **API rate limiting, XSS protection, and SQL injection protection are implemented.**
- **Debug endpoints (e.g., /env-test) have been removed for production security.**
- **CORS is configured for a public API (all origins allowed).**
- **Error messages are hardened: no stack traces or sensitive info are returned to clients.**

## ‚è≥ What‚Äôs Next (Options)

1. **Security & Hardening**
   - Rotate secrets if any were exposed during debugging.

2. **Testing**
   - Add or expand integration tests for all endpoints (especially edge cases and error handling).
   - Test file/folder operations thoroughly.

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Add production logging (e.g., Winston, Sentry) if desired.
   - Set up alerts for errors or downtime.

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README and deployment docs with any new findings or best practices.
   - Ensure onboarding is easy for new devs.

5. **Feature Development**
   - Add new features (e.g., file/folder renaming, metadata, admin endpoints) as needed.
   - Build a simple web UI if desired.

6. **Performance**
   - Profile and optimize any slow endpoints or DB queries.
