# Concise Plan for Coding the S3-like Storage API

## 1. Project Setup
- Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript.
- Set up folder structure as per enterprise recommendations.
- Configure environment variables for:
  - FTP credentials (super user, never hardcoded)
  - MS SQL Server connection
  - API keys/secrets

## 2. Database Integration
- Install and configure Sequelize ORM for MS SQL Server.
- Create Sequelize config, models, and associations for:
  - Buckets
  - Files (with metadata)
  - Users/API keys (if needed)
- Set up migrations and seeders for initial schema and test data.

## 3. Core API Development
- Implement authentication middleware (API key/token-based).
- Develop endpoints for:
  - Bucket management (create, list)
  - File operations (upload, list, download, delete)
- Integrate FTP logic in service layer (using env var creds for FTP super user).
- Ensure all business logic is in services, not controllers.

## 4. Testing (TDD)
- Use Jest for unit and integration tests.
- Write tests for:
  - Services (FTP, DB logic)
  - Controllers/routes
  - Middlewares
- Organize tests to mirror `src/` structure.

## 5. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- Use Playwright (or another popular framework) for E2E API tests.
- Write scenarios covering:
  - Auth flows
  - Bucket and file operations
  - Error cases and edge conditions

## 6. Documentation & DevOps
- Document API endpoints, env vars, and setup in `docs/`.
- Add scripts for:
  - Running migrations/seeders
  - Starting dev/test/prod environments
- Ensure linting, formatting, and best practices are enforced.

**Notes:**
- FTP credentials are always loaded from environment variables and used as the "super user" for all FTP operations.
- The API layer enforces all business logic, permissions, and metadata, just like AWS S3.
- All code is written in TypeScript and follows TDD principles.
